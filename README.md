InfiniSweeper

A limitless Minesweeper experience where score reigns supreme!

Description

InfiniSweeper takes the classic Minesweeper formula and throws in a dash of infinity. The board expands endlessly in all directions, offering an unending challenge. Forget clearing the board - aim for the highest score by strategically revealing safe cells as you navigate the ever-growing minefield.

Features

Infinite Board: Explore a boundless grid of hidden squares, filled with both safe spaces and deadly mines.
Score-Based Gameplay: Rack up points by revealing safe cells. Every click counts!
Basic Mechanics: Use arrow keys or WASD to move, click to reveal a cell, and right-click to mark a suspected mine.
Quick Navigation: Jump to the board's center with the "C" key or revisit your last click with "L".
Upcoming Features

Leaderboard System: Compete against other players and see who can conquer the infinite minefield.
Quick Clear: Simplify safe areas by automatically revealing cells once enough flags are placed around them.
